## Total Space Saved: ~1.4-1.6 pages

**Estimated Current Length**: ~6-6.2 pages (before adding additional figures)

---

## Current Status

### Figures Included:
1. ✅ **Figure 1**: Training Results (4-panel) - `training_results.png`
2. ❌ **Figure 2**: System Architecture - NOT YET CREATED
3. ❌ **Figure 3**: Transfer Learning Flow - NOT YET CREATED

### What's Next:

**Option 1: Create Additional Figures (Recommended)**
- The paper currently has only 1 figure, which is minimal for a 6-page paper
- Create 2 additional figures using Draw.io (see `FIGURES_TO_CREATE_NOW.md`)
  - Priority 1: System Architecture (~20-30 minutes)
  - Priority 2: Sequential Transfer Learning Flow (~20-30 minutes)
- These figures will add visual appeal and clarity to the paper
- Figures will consume ~0.3-0.5 pages of space

**Option 2: Upload to Overleaf Now**
- If short on time, upload the current condensed version to Overleaf
- Compile to check exact page count
- AAAI template may render slightly differently than estimated

---

## Files Ready for Overleaf Upload

All files in `D:\rl_tuned_mpc\paper\` directory:

1. `main.tex` - Condensed main paper file
2. `references.bib` - Bibliography with corrected years
3. `aaai24.sty` - AAAI style file
4. `training_results.png` - Training results figure
5. `compile.bat` - Compilation script (optional, Overleaf compiles automatically)

**Additional files to create (if you choose to make figures)**:
- `figures/system_architecture.pdf` (Draw.io)
- `figures/transfer_learning_flow.pdf` (Draw.io)

---

## Recommendation

1. **Upload current version to Overleaf** and compile to see exact page count
2. **If under 5.5 pages**: Create 2 additional figures to improve visual presentation
3. **If at 5.8-6 pages**: Upload as is or create 1 additional figure
4. **If over 6 pages**: May need minor additional condensing in Results section

---

## Quality Check Before Submission

- ✅ All 22 references verified as genuine with DOI links
- ✅ Real experimental data used throughout
- ✅ Mathematical formulations complete
- ✅ Algorithm 1 included
- ✅ Tables with experimental results
- ✅ Abstract concise and informative
- ⚠️ Only 1 figure (recommended: 2-3 figures for visual appeal)

---

**Next Step**: Upload to Overleaf and compile to verify exact page count, then decide on figure creation strategy.
